# edX Exam Management System
这个项目是允许使用Open edX进行授课的老师从所授的几门课程中，指定题目或根据条件抽取习题形成试卷，安排学生账号进行考试，查看考试成绩。

## Getting Start

1. Install the requirement
```bash
make install
```

2. Setup DB
```
make dev.makemigrations

make dev.migrate
```

3. Run the server
```bash
make dev.up
```

4. View api document
Just access `http://0.0.0.0:8111/swagger`
Ps: you have to login to view all api document.

## Configuration
```
EDX_API = {
    # your open edX host
    'HOST': 'http://0.0.0.0:8001',
     # api to get section's problems
    'SECTION_PROBLEM': '/exam/section/problems',
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization
By default, this application relies on an external OAuth2/Open ID Connect provider
(contained within the [LMS](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform)) for authentication and authorization.

Note: When using Open ID Connect, the dashboard and provider must be accessed via different host names
(e.g. dashboard.example.org and provider.example.org) in order to avoid issues with session cookies being overwritten.

Note 2: Seeing signature expired errors upon login? Make sure the clocks of your dashboard and OAuth servers are synced
with a centralized time server. If you are using a VM, the VM's clock may skew when the host is suspended. Restarting
the NTP service usually resolves this issue.
